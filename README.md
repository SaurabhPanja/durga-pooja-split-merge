# durga-pooja-split-merge
This repo has code to split and merge videos using movies.py

### Note to self.
Chiku gave me very heavy files, in order to compress them I used to screen recorder.
The screen recorder recorded in webm format, I used ffmpeg library to convert it to mp4, so that I can split them using moviepy to split it.
This split videos for uploaded to canva to make na L-shaped advertisement around them.
In between the videos I also had to add advertisement.
To create a merge and insert advertisement. I used moviepy merge function.
